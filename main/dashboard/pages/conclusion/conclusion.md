# Do you know what happens to your skin?

##Research question:
###  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Does a KN95 mask affect the skin microbiome and the blood oxygen saturation significanly in comparison when wearing no mask?

## Conclusion
###  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The SpO<sub>2</sub> is not significantly lower when wearing a KN95 mask.
###  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The microbiome composition differs greatly.

## Future research
###  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Duration of the experiment
###  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Types of mask
###  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Measuring oxygen saturation
